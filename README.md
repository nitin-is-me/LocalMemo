## About LocalMemo
Local Memo, is a note taking web app, but unlike <a href="https://github.com/nitin-is-me/clustered/">Clustered</a>:
<ul>
  <li>It has no backend, which means, it saves data locally on device.</li>
  <li>Every user has data seperatedly saved on his/her device, so it won't be visible to me either, giving space to privacy.</li>
  <li>It's just coded in HTML, a bit of css with BootStrap and Vanilla JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<br>
Local Memo is being hosted on <a href="https://nitin-is-me.github.io/LocalMemo">Github</a>, and <a href="localmemo.vercel.app">Vercel</a>.
